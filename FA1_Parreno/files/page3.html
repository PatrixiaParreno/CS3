		<h1> Mountain Biking </h1>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<li> My dad is in the cycling industry (both as a rider and as a business man). Given this, I was naturally exposed to the sport. </li>
			<li> I started cycling at 2, removed the training wheels at 3, and I started exploring the mountains somewhere around 6 or 7. </li>
			<li> Mountain biking is tiring but it's very rewarding. Looking at the scenery while riding is hard since you need to focus on the trail, but when you reach the destination, you will marvel at the view! </li>
