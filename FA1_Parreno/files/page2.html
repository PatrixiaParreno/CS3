			<li> Figure skating is actually similar to ballet is some ways. Both look very elegant, poised, and light; however, it is an extremely difficut sport to master. </li>
			<li> I find it a very mezmerizing sport to watch.</li>
			<li> My favorite figure skater is Yuzuru Hanyu. Yuzu's way of skating is very expressive, he has this special aura that captures the audiences attention. </li>
