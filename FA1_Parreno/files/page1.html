		<ul>
			<li> Playing impoves our hand-eye coordination, it stimulates mental alertness, concentration, and tactical strategy. </li>
			<li> The week I started playing, everything hurted - when I laughed, walked down stairs, literally everything. But amidst this pain, I was still enjoying the sport; eventually the pain subsided.</li>
			<li> One game of Table Tennis does't last long (especially if the players are pros), that's why many sets are played during competitions. </li>
