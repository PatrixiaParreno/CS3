			<h2> Official Rules of Table Tennis </h2>
			<p> In order to actually play the game, one must know the basic rules of
Table Tennis. These rules will help anyone play their game straight.
			</div>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h3> 1. GAMES ARE PLAYED TO 11 POINTS </h3>
			<p> The game is played to 11 points. A game must be won by two points. 
Usually, matches are best three of five games; but the number of sets may vary. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> 2. CHANGE OF SERVES EVERY TWO POINTS </h3>
			<p id="des2"> Each player alternates serving every two points. The only exception is
when a deuce happens (10-10). In this case, the serve alternates every point. Serves are extremely important
in table tennis! It can make or break the game. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> 3. TOSS THE BALL STRAIGHT UP WHEN SERVING </h3>
			<p> Hold the palm in your open palm, behind your side of the table. Toss atleast 16cm
(net height) up, and you must only strike the ball as it makes its way down. It must first hit your side of the
table before hitting the opponents side. The play begins when the ball is tossed. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> 4.  A SERVE THAT TOUCHES THE NET ON THE WAY OVER IS A “LET” </h3>
			<p>  If a served ball hits the net on the way over and otherwise legally bounces in play, 
it’s a “let” serve and is done over. There is no limit on how many times this can happen. However, if the ball touches the
net during a rally it is perfectly fine. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> 5. VOLLEYS ARE NOT ALLOWED </h3>
			<p> You may not hit the ball before it bounce on your side - this is considered as your
opponents point.
			<br>
			<h3> 6. IF YOUR HIT BOUNCES BACK OVER THE NET BY ITSELF IT IS YOUR POINT </h3>
			<p> If you hit the ball in a rally or on a serve and it bounces back over the net after 
hitting your opponent’s side of the table (due to extreme spin), without your opponent touching it, that is your point. </p>
			<br>
			<h3> 7. TOUCHING THE BALL WITH YOUR PADDLE HAND IS ALLOWED </h3>
			<p> If the ball touches your PADDLE hand and otherwise results in a legal hit, there is no 
rule violation and play shall continue as normal. Your paddle hand includes all fingers and hand area below the wrist. However, if
it touches your non-padle hand or anywhere else on your body, it is considered your opponents point.
