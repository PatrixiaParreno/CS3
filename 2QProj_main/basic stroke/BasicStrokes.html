				<h2 id="forehand"> Forehand </h2>
				<p> A forehand drive is an attacking shot. It’s played with a little bit of topspin, but mainly 
it’s a flat hit and can be very powerful. It is the most common hit in the game; as beginners, we must first master the forehand strike. 
Start with bat around waist height. Close the bat angle slightly. Rotate backwards from the waist. As the ball approaches, rotate forwards 
and move your bat forwards and up. Contact the ball just in front of your body. The contact should be quite flat, roughly in the middle of 
your bat. Your bat should follow through and finish in front of your body.

				<h2 id="strokes"> Strokes </h2>
				<p> Strokes or Drives are the most basic moves in table tennis, along with the serve. This is what
keeps the game going. A stroke is how a player hits the ball. Learning how to properly hit the ball is extremely important. Improvising
can help you play; but if you learn the fundamentals, it will be a whole new story. </p>

				<h2 id="backhand"> Backhand</h2>
				<p> A backhand shot involves turning your arm slightly across your body to hit the ball.Like the forehand, 
the backhand can also be broken down into four components – your stance, the backswing, the strike and the finish. Position your body square 
to the line of play – this means both feet should point diagonally towards your opponent. Knees bent, body crouched (leaning forwards), both 
arms out in front of you with a slight bend at the elbow. As the ball approaches, bring your racket towards your body. Keep your body aligned 
and balanced. Once you’re ready to hit the ball, move your arm towards the ball. Tap the ball to push the ball forwards, and use your wrist for 
more power and direction. Your follow-through should follow the ball to the direction you’ve aimed. Recover to your 
ready position and anticipate the next shot.
