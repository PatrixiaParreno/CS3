			<h2> SPIN: the deadly hidden side of Table Tennis </h2>
			<p> In the early of table tennis most players used a traditional
"hardbat" which is consisted of pimpled rubber, without sponge, on a wooden blade. This
entails that the game soley relies on ball placement and control. After the introduction of
the sponge in the 1950s, it became possible to impart spin on the ball. The use of spin is
now the most dominant factor in the sport. For anyone who wants to improve their game, 
being able to recieve and strike a spin is an important skill to master.
			<h2 id="des1"> The basics of spin </h2>
			<h4> practice makes perfect </h4>
			<p> no player can immediately learn spin. It is a skill that relies 
on constant practice and improvement. <p>
			<ol>
				<li> When you hit the ball near its center with your racket at a 90
degree angle, the ball will travel forward more and have less to no spin.<li>
				<li> When you brush the ball with your racket at an angle of less than
or more than 90 degrees (using an upward, sideward, or downward movement) the ball will spin more and
not travel as far forward. </li>
			</ol>

			<h3> Top Spin </h3>
			<p> Topspin is produced by starting your stroke below the ball and brushing your
racket tangentially against the ball in an UPWARD motion. The faster the stroke, the more spin. When top 
spin is implied the ball stays low and accelerates forward.</p>
			<h3> Backspin </h3>
			<p> Backspin is produced by starting your stroke above the ball and brushing your 
racket tangentially against the ball in a DOWNWARD motion. When backspin is implied, the ball will rise 
up more and not travel as far.</p>
			<h3> Side Spin </h3>
			<p> Side spin is produced by starting your stroke above the ball and brushing your 
racket tangentially against the ball in a SIDEWAYS motion. When you impart left side spin on the ball, it 
will move to the right - and vice versa. </p>
