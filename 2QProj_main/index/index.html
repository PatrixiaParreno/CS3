			<p id="p1" > Table Tennis, also known as Ping-pong, is a sport similar to lawn tennis.
It is played on a flat table divided into two courts by a net fixed in the middle. Similar to lawn tennis, 
players also use a racket when playing. The ball used in table tennis is hollow and light-weight. The number of
players per game may vary from 2 to 4, depending on the event. Learning table tennis is easy, but mastering it is 
a whole new level. Like other sports, mastering table tennis also takes years of practice. The first week of training will be painful, 
especially if one does not stretch properly. But as time progresses, our muscles will become used to the activity; hence they get less sore. 
In order to truly master the basics, drills must be performed regularly.
