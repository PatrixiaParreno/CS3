			<h1> Service </h1>
			<p id="des1"> Many beginner and intermediate players dread 
having to practice table tennis serving, often viewing it as a boring and overly repetitive 
exercise. However, it’s very important. Your service remains one of the most important shots 
in table tennis — a player can never have enough practice in trying to improve their service 
game. Think about it. The service is the only shot in which you have complete control over 
the ball, so you had better make sure you seize the opportunity. </p>
			<br>
			<div>
				<h3> Rules </h3>
				<p> The ball should be resting flat in the player's open
palm. You are not allowed to grip the ball. The ball must be thrown behind the white line of
the table, and must exceed 16cm (net height) in terms of height. A player cannot hide their 
serves - this is against the rules. The opponent must see how you do your serve. </p>

			<h3> Benefits </h3>
			<h4> A killer serve will guarantee you 50%! </h4>
			<p id="des1"> Tricky ping pong serves will give your opponent hell, and force a 
lot of errors. You’ll likely win points outright from failed returns, but you’ll also win points 
from poor returns, which are there to be punished. Even if you only win one out of every four 
points as a direct result of your serve, that places you at a major advantage if your opponent isn’t 
winning any points as a result of their serve.</p>

			<h3> What makes a great serve? </h3>
		<article>
			<h4 id="spin"> Deceptive Spin </h4>
			<p> Undoubtedly, the strongest aspect of a quality serve is the spin. It’s 
usually loaded, and very difficult to read. Getting the ball back on the table is almost a victory in 
itself, even if it’s high and will likely be put away. </p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h4 id="speed"> Varied Speed </h4>
			<p> To upset rhythm, quality servers will alter the pace of their serves to 
catch you out. This is usually in the form of a few fast serves every game. </p>
		</article>
		<article>
			<h4 id="placement"> Varied Placement </h4>
			<p> Great servers are masters of placement, and have super control of where 
the ball lands. If they need to remain safe, they will keep the ball short so that you cannot attack 
with a loop or drive. However, they will likely also serve long at times, depending on your attacking 
ability. This helps put you under pressure and forces mistakes.</p>
